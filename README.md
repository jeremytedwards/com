# Update 11 - Single-Page Apps

As a user updated this site to be a Single Page Application (SPA) by using the page.js library to capture clicks and 
execute a function to modify the page, rather than reloading content from a server.

Update your main nav so that each clickable item is a link to a different url, that is handled by a function as indicated 
by page.js.

Keep the code organized in a M-V-C structure that isolates data management from presentation layer, from the controller 
that holds it all together.
